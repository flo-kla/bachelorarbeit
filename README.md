# bachelorarbeit
This repository contains the iDeepDNe as well as LDA models used for the experiments on the 20 newsgroups and 20subs in my bachelor thesis 
"Comparison of neural networks with generative probabilistic topic models in natural
language processing based on different metrics"


data contains all four datasets together with their preprocessing scripts.
LDA contains all models together with their hyperparameter finetuning and experimental evaluation scripts.
iDeepDNe contains all models together training & evaluation scripts.
